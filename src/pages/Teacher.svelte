        <p>I enjoy teaching music as much as I do performing. I teach the Suzuki method with a large variety of additional repertoire including new music, folk music, pop music, and student compositions. I am constantly searching for new works and composers from underrepresented groups to provide students with a broad appreciation for the amazing diversity in classical music and music in general. My students can be found studying diverse pieces from J.S. Bach to Florence Price to Lindsey Stirling.</p>
