            <p>Roman Yearian is a violinist and teacher based in Guanajuato, México. He performs with the <a href="https://www.ugto.mx/osug/">Orquesta Sinfónica de la Universidad de Guanajuato</a> as Principal Second and teaches at the Orquesta Jóvenes Líderes del Sistema Bajío in León, México. In addition to teaching and performing, he has started the chamber concert series ... that highlights the work of women composers.</p>  
            <p>Originally from Bellingham, Washington, Roman began his violin studies with his grandmother, Patricia Yearian, a Suzuki violin teacher. Roman continued his studies with Sandra Payton and Walter Schwede before he entered the <a href="https://www.lynn.edu/academics/colleges/conservatory">Lynn Conservatory of Music</a> in Florida as a student of Elmar Oliveira. He completed his Bachelor's degree at the University of Texas at Austin where he studied with Brian Lewis. He has performed with the Austin Symphony and Opera, the Florida Orchestra and as a Fellow with the New World Symphony in Miami. In past summers Roman served as concertmaster for tours of Europe and México with the Orchestra of the Americas and Schleswig-Holstein Festival Orchestra. </p>
            <p>Roman is very enthusiastic about spending time in nature and spent a year away from the violin working with a conservation corps volunteering in several National Parks in Utah and Texas. He often seeks to integrate his love for nature in concerts through the ongoing Bach in the Wild series. He has performed in a diverse range of natural spaces, from the swamps of Everglades National Park to the desert in West Texas. During the Covid pandemic he performed in the mountains outside of Guanajuato with cellist Leslie Caballero in a concert streamed on the local network. In his free time Roman enjoys reading, hiking, and learning to cook new recipes.</p>
